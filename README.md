# simplecov-mcp

An MCP server that lets Claude directly access SimpleCov coverage reports.

No need to read the entire `coverage/.resultset.json` (which can be tens of MB). Retrieve only the data you need via tools.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/simplecov-mcp.git
cd simplecov-mcp
pnpm install && pnpm build
```

Then, in your Rails project root, register the MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add simplecov node /path/to/simplecov-mcp/build/index.js
```

This adds the MCP server to your project's `.mcp.json`. The server automatically detects the `coverage/` directory from the working directory.

To specify the coverage path explicitly:

```bash
claude mcp add simplecov -e SIMPLECOV_COVERAGE_PATH=/path/to/coverage node /path/to/simplecov-mcp/build/index.js
```

After adding, restart Claude Code and verify with `/mcp`.

## Tools

### `get_summary`

Returns the overall coverage summary.

```
> get_summary

{
  "lastRun": { "line": 100, "branch": 100 },
  "totalFiles": 1669,
  "computed": { "lineCoverage": 53.56, "branchCoverage": 48.07 }
}
```

### `list_files`

Lists files with their coverage rates. Supports sorting and filtering.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sort_by` | `path` \| `line_coverage` \| `branch_coverage` \| `missed_lines` | `path` | Sort key |
| `order` | `asc` \| `desc` | `asc` | Sort order |
| `min_coverage` | number | - | Minimum coverage percentage |
| `max_coverage` | number | - | Maximum coverage percentage |
| `path_pattern` | string | - | Partial match filter for file paths |

```
> list_files sort_by=missed_lines order=desc max_coverage=50

[
  { "file": ".../inquiries_controller.rb", "line": "8.96% (37/413)", "missed": 376 },
  ...
]
```

### `get_file_coverage`

Returns detailed coverage for a specific file, including per-line hit counts, uncovered line numbers, and branch coverage.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `file_path` | string (required) | File path. Matched by suffix |

```
> get_file_coverage file_path=app/models/user.rb

{
  "filePath": "/usr/src/app/app/models/user.rb",
  "lineCoverage": "85.71% (12/14)",
  "uncoveredLineNumbers": [42, 43],
  "lines": [...],
  "branches": [...]
}
```

### `get_uncovered_lines`

Extracts only uncovered lines and branches. Useful when adding tests.

```
> get_uncovered_lines file_path=app/services/order_service.rb

{
  "filePath": "/usr/src/app/app/services/order_service.rb",
  "lineCoverage": "72.5%",
  "uncoveredLineNumbers": [15, 16, 42, 43, 44],
  "uncoveredBranches": [
    { "condition": "[:if, 3, 15, 6, 15, 40]", "branch": "[:else, 5, 15, 6, 15, 40]" }
  ]
}
```

## Usage Examples with Claude

```
"Show me files with low coverage"
"Show uncovered lines in app/models/user.rb"
"List controllers with coverage below 50%"
"Write tests for the uncovered lines in this file"
```

## How It Works

```
Rails Project
├── coverage/
│   ├── .resultset.json  ← Generated by SimpleCov (tens of MB)
│   └── .last_run.json   ← Summary
└── .mcp.json            ← MCP configuration (created by claude mcp add)

simplecov-mcp searches for the coverage/ directory starting from cwd,
then walking up to parent directories. It parses .resultset.json and
holds the data in memory. Claude retrieves only the needed portions
via tools.
```
